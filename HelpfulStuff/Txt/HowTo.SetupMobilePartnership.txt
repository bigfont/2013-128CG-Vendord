--

Note: This entire process might not be necessary. That said, it works. :-)

- Delete the C:/Windows/WindowsMobile directory, because it contains Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC)
- This might require ending these processes and services
	- Windows Mobile Device Center
	- Microsoft Sync Center
	- Windows Mobile-2003-based device connectivity
	- Windows Mobile-based device connectivity

- Once that directory is gone, open Programs & Features.
- Completely remove 
	- Windows Mobile Device Center.
	- Windows Mobile Device Center Driver Update.
- You might have to run Microsoft Fixit to ensure the following:

- Now that WMDC is gone, plug in the mobile device.
- Turn on the mobile device.
- You might have to connect and disconnect the device several times to complete the following steps: 
	- It will install the Sync Cradle.
	- Install Windows Mobile Device Center
