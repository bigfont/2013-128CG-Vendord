Handheld Bugs
---

1 When we add a new product through IT Retail, then sync with IT Retail, then Sync with handheld, 
then open the handheld, then scan the new product, 

- with a new order and new database
- with an existing order and existing database
- with a new order and existing database 

the product doesn't show. But if we then go back and scan the product a second time, it does show.

	Watch and Wait:
	- I was not able to replicate the error.

2 Continue without selecting an order closes or freezes. Done.
3 Delete without selected an order closes or freezes. Done.

	Fix:
	- Add to the code contract for each involved method.
	- Add a message to request selection of an item.

4 On sync the orders that were deleted on the handheld do not delete on the desktop. Done. Hooray!!!

	Fix:
	- Refactor the Sync Framework code.
	- The main fix was to use SQL Server CE 3.5 SP2 on the device and the machine.	  

5 Deleting multiple orders in a row freezes or closes. Done. 

	Fix: 
	- Fixing number 2 and 3 above appears to have fixed this too. 

6 Deleting and then creating and then deleting and then creating freezes or closes. Done. 

	Fix:
	- Fixing number 2 and 3 above appears to have fixed this.

When syncing with the handheld, create the remote database if it doesn't exist.
