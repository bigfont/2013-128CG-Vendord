- Clicking "Get Products from IT Retail" hangs when there is no database connection. Done.

- Deleting an Order on the mobile device doesn't delete it on the desktop app. Not done.
	Fixing this will require something other than "Delete".
	Instead we will have to use something like "Trash".
	Then we can empty the trash on sync.
