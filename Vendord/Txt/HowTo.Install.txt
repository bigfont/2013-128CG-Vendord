HowTo: Install Vendord Desktop
--

Note: This entire process might not be necessary. That said, it works. :-)

- Delete the C:/Windows/WindowsMobile directory, because it contains Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC)
- This might require ending some services / processes
	- Windows Mobile Device Center
	- Windows Mobile-2003-based device connectivity
	- Windows Mobile-based device connectivity

- Once that directory is gone, open Programs & Features
- Uninstall Windows Mobile Device Center.
- Uninstall Windows Mobile Device Center Driver Update.
- Tripple check with Microsoft Fixit to ensure WMDC is gone.

- Now that WMDC is gone, plug in the mobile device.
- Turn on the mobile device.

- Then, go to bigfont.ca/clickonce/vendord/publish.htm
- Click Install
- Run setup.exe
- Accept each End User Liscence Agreement
